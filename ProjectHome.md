This project delves into the use of Artificial Intelligence in the domain of Games. The efforts of Artificial Intelligence have always been in its ability to imitate human intelligence and eventually surpass the ability of the human mind (IBMâ€™s Deep Blue Chess System defeated Grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997). In the early days of video gaming the computer controlled opponents relied on repetitive patterns or random motions that used a hard coded table of pseudo random numbers whose actions  becomes predictable after playing and analyzing a couple of times. However, the latest generation of game engines shows clearly that the trend leads towards more realistic physics simulations, agent centered perception, and complex player interactions. With more users now focusing keenly on the AI aspect of a game, developing a game that offers immersive gameplay with competitive opponents and taking into account the resource constraints for such an AI system has become a challenge for the game developers. My project aims at creating a smart computer system controlled opponent that exhibits intelligent decision making tactics that addresses some of the vast panorama of specialized Game-AI sub-problems including pathfinding, tactical analysis,weapon-handling and physics based collision detection.
